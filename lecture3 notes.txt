I have learnt about:
1.Constatns in C++:
    Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter and they are called literals. Constants can be of any of the basic data types and can be divided into Integer Numerals, Floating-Point Numerals, Characters, Strings and Boolean Values.

2.Variables in c++
     A variable is a name of memory location. It is used to store data. Its value can be changed and it can be reused many times.

It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily identified.
"Rules for defining variables":
 1.A variable can have alphabets, digits and underscore.
2.A variable name can start with alphabet and underscore only. It can't start with digit.
3.No white space is allowed within variable name.
4.A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword e.g. char, float etc.
Valid variable names:
int a;    
int _ab;    
int a30; 

DATA TYPES:
A data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such as integer, floating, character etc.

Types	Data Types:
Basic Data Type	:
int, char, float, double, etc
Derived Data Type:
array, pointer, etc
